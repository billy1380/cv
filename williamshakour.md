## Work Experience

### 2019-Present Contracting - X-Platform Software Engineer
I have been working with companies trying to launch their apps on multiple platforms (Android and iOS) at the same time using Flutter.

The latest project has been the [Train Wright app](https://apps.apple.com/lv/app/train-wright/id1549546871) which launched in 2021. Both the mobile app and the admin system were written in Flutter. Both utilising Firebase and run on mobile, desktop and in the browser.

### 2018-2019 [NUM](https://www.num.uk/) - Software Engineer
As a software engineer I worked on the platform's Dart and JS SDKs. I also created a web demo app in VueJS and a Flutter based browser plugin to show capabilities and speed of the protocol.

### 2017-2018 [Reducer](https://reducer.co.uk/) - Software Engineer
As a Software engineer I worked on creating the Reducer API using swagger on top of AWS and migrating JSP pages to VueJS app using the new API. I also worked on the integration with Quickbooks API.

### 2016-2017 - [Puzzle London](https://puzzlelondon.com/) - CTO
Worked on various projects. Roles included solution architecture, building server APIs, web and mobile apps. I also build out the development team interviewing and hiring candidates for the team.

### 2011-Present [SPACEHOPPER STUDIOS Ltd.](http://www.spacehopperstudios.com) - Software engineer and co-Director
I have worked on many projects mostly related to games and occasionally web projects in between to keep the company earning (which is part of the responsibility of having a company). I have written code in objective-c for iOS and C++ (using cocos2dx) as well as Java (using libgdx). Titles include Hollywood hospital, commissioned and written for Zed, Ka-Bloom, commissioned and written for the BBC and SPACEHOPPER STUDIOSâ€™ very own title [Delta-V](http://www.deltavgame.com) which is available on Android and iOS. In the process I have coded a few tools to help aid level design, optimising assets among others (ask for details).

We are working our latest mobile game right now!

### 2013-2015 [Reflection.io](http://www.reflection.io) - CTO and co-Founder
Architected, designed and coded a system to import application rank data daily to allow statistical analysis aimed at determining the potential earnings of each application. The system was built on top of Google Cloud platform and used GWT to build the desktop site. Of the cloud platform technologies, we leveraged, App engine pull and push queues, Compute engine virtual machines, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage and Cloud datastore for rapid access to data summaries and managing the pipeline API.
I also helped with recruitment of various team members and accessing their progress. This, for me, was by far the hardest part of the role.

### 2003-2011 Atos Origin UK Ltd. (now Atos) - Software engineer (junior - senior)
Worked on various projects related to the transport (rail) industry in various sized teams using a very wide range of technologies on various platforms ranging from servers (including visualisation using MS Virtual Server 2005) to portable devices. I later cross trained into Java after which I worked on various web projects for government organisations e.g. DEFRA and the DWP.

### 2000-2001 BTexaCT - Industrial Placement Year (junior developer, intern)
Worked on a project that aimed at the development of an FDD (frequency division duplex) capacity simulator for 3G mobile phone networks. Network technologies under consideration were W-CDMA and EDGE.
