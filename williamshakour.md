## Work Experience

###2011-Present [SPACEHOPPER STUDIOS Ltd.](http://www.spacehopperstudios.com) - Software engineer and co-Director
I have worked on many projects mostly related to games and occasionally web projects in between to keep the company earning (which is part of the responsibility of having a company). I have written code in objective-c for iOS and C++ (using cocos2dx) as well as Java (using libgdx). Titles include Hollywood hospital, commissioned and written for Zed, Ka-Bloom, commissioned and written for the BBC and SPACEHOPPER STUDIOS’ very own title [Delta-V](http://www.deltavgame.com) which is available on Android and iOS. In the process I have coded a few tools to help aid level design, optimising assets among others (ask for details).

### 2013-2015 [Reflection.io](http://www.reflection.io) - CTO and co-Founder
Architected, designed and coded a system to import application rank data daily to allow statistical analysis aimed at determining the potential earnings of each application. The system was built on top of Google Cloud platform and used GWT to build the desktop site. Of the cloud platform technologies, we leveraged, App engine pull and push queues, Compute engine virtual machines, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage and Cloud datastore for rapid access to data summaries and managing the pipeline API.
I also helped with recruitment of various team members and accessing their progress. This, for me, was by far the hardest part of the role.

###2003-2011 Atos Origin UK Ltd. (now Atos) - Software engineer (junior - senior)
Worked on various projects related to the transport (rail) industry in various sized teams using a very wide range of technologies on various platforms ranging from servers (including visualisation using MS Virtual Server 2005) to portable devices. I later cross trained into Java after which I worked on various web projects for government organisations e.g. DEFRA and the DWP.

###2000-2001 BTexaCT - Industrial Placement Year (junior developer, intern)
Worked on a project that aimed at the development of an FDD (frequency division duplex) capacity simulator for 3G mobile phone networks. Network technologies under consideration were W-CDMA and EDGE.

##Contracting
I am available for contract work via [WillShex Limited](https://www.willshex.com).

##Education

###1998-2002 UMIST (now University of Manchester) - Software Engineering with Industrial Experience - Attained 1st.
My university course covered quite a broad set of subjects related to computers and software development such as computer science, IT laws and data protection, Human interface design and concurrent programming languages. It also included a year in industry that I spent working for BTexaCT.

###1992-1998 Unity High School in Khartoum
__A-levels\:__
AS-Maths __A (a)__, Chemistry __B (b)__, Math __B (b)__ and Physics __B (b)__

__IGCSEs\:__

##Skills
- Proficient in Java and have used various frameworks (e.g. spring) to set up web projects. I have used SWT and am very experienced with GWT.
- Proficient in UML based OOD using tools such as MS Visio (for Visual Studio) and various other tools e.g. Eclipse modelling framework.
- Expert in developing web and Windows applications in C# and .NET framework (1.0 - 3.5). I also have MCPs in coding using C# and developing web applications. 
- Proficient in SQL through use of different versions of MySQL as well as some experience with SQL server 2005.
- Expert programming in C and C++ with windows programming (MFC and Borland Builder) including some knowledge of graphics written in OpenGL.
- Knowledge of other languages includes php (expert), javascript (proficient) HTML (proficient) and XML (including WSDL, SOAP etc.) obtained through work on various web projects.
- Extensively used SVN and more recently Git for source control.

I have worked with PHP on a LAMP stack for a long time but these days my preferred setup of choice is the lovely no config App Engine environment.

###Interests and Activities
I enjoy some sports mainly basketball, table tennis and swimming, although I don’t do much of any of those any more. For a few years now, I have mostly been reading/writing code and any remaining time I have has been taken over by other technology interests like playing with Blender, OpenSCAD, sketching and keeping up with developments in DIY 3D printers.
